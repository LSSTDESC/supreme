*Su*rvey *Pr*op*ê*rty *M*aps with healspars*e* for the LSST survey

This code uses [healsparse](https://github.com/lsstdesc/healsparse) to make
survey property maps for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC).

## Notes:

This software was developed within the LSST DESC using LSST DESC resources, and
so meets the criteria given in, and is bound by, the LSST DESC Publication
Policy for being a “DESC product”.  We welcome requests to access the code for
non-DESC use; if you wish to use the code outside DESC please contact the
developers.

This code is under development and has not yet been released.
